# Invoice from budget

Wizard to issue an invoice from an accepted budget on the `budget`
module. Supports **full or partial billing**: by default all
uninvoiced items, but you can pick which lines and quantities to
include.

## At a glance

- **Only from accepted budgets.** If the budget is not in
  `accepted` (or already has a non-cancelled active invoice), the
  *Create invoice* button on the budget detail does not appear.
- **Per-item check.** Each budget line shows `invoiced / total`.
  You can only add the remainder or part of it; the backend
  rejects exceeding the pending quantity.
- **Price snapshot.** Lines are copied from the budget with their
  current price and VAT — so the invoice isn't affected by later
  catalog changes.
- **Discounts travel with the lines.** The quote's line discount
  **and** its global discount (spread across the lines, ex-tax) are
  written on each invoice line — the invoice totals what the patient
  signed. On partial invoicing the discount is prorated by the
  invoiced quantity; the discount caption on each row follows the
  quantity you are invoicing. Unselected rows show the quote's net
  price. The preview shows the same figures the invoice will have.
- **Receiver.** Defaults to the patient. You can switch to a
  different payer (company, insurer, family member) before issuing.
- **Billing data.** The card shows the name, tax id and email the
  invoice will carry. If the patient has neither a tax id nor a
  DNI/NIE, a *Missing data* warning appears with an **Edit patient
  data** button that opens the billing modal and returns here on
  save.
- **Payment terms.** Only shown when the budget still has an
  outstanding amount. A fully collected budget produces an invoice
  with no terms or due date.

## Invoice from a budget

> Requires `billing.write`.

1. You arrive here from the budget detail (*Create invoice*).
2. Review the list: tick / untick lines and adjust the quantities
   to invoice.
3. If the invoice goes to a third party, configure the alternate
   payer.
4. **Create invoice**. The endpoint
   `POST /billing/invoices/from-budget/{budget_id}` is called with
   the selected items. The invoice is born in `draft` with the
   snapshots copied.
5. To issue, open the [detail](./invoices_id.md) and click
   **Issue**.

## Permissions

| What you see / can do | Permission |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Load the wizard and see the budget | `billing.read` |
| Create the invoice | `billing.write` |

## Troubleshooting

- **No *Create invoice* button on the budget.** The budget is not
  `accepted`, already has a non-cancelled invoice, or every item
  is invoiced 100%.
- **Backend returns 400 on create.** You picked more quantity than
  pending. Check `invoiced_quantity` vs `quantity` per line.
- **A budget line is missing.** It is already 100% invoiced
  (`invoiced_quantity == quantity`). To revert, void or delete the
  draft invoice (or issue a credit note for an issued one) and re-enter
  this wizard — the lines come back as soon as the document is voided.
